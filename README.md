# I'm not developing this project, *yet*.

Why?
Because I'm learning best practices and improving my skills, I'll restart this project and build from the 0, with Typescript.

Why did you stop?
I was building it in a YouTube tutorial, but it just seems like I was writing code for nothing, without learn nothing, so, check this portfolio where I'm building another E-commerce with NextJS and Typescript. ðŸ‘‰ https://github.com/ferreira-dev27/casecobra
